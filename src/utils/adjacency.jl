"""
    contiguity_adjacency(geoms; rule = :queen)

Build a binary contiguity adjacency matrix `W` for polygonal geometries.

- `geoms`: Vector of geometries. Accepts `LibGEOS.Geometry` or GeoInterface-compatible objects
           that LibGEOS can wrap via `LibGEOS.Geometry(geom)`.
- `rule`:  Contiguity definition. Currently supports `:queen` (share any boundary point).

Returns a sparse, symmetric `SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int}` with zero diagonal, where
`W[i,j] = 1.0` iff areas i and j are contiguous under the chosen rule.

Notes
- Complexity is O(nÂ²) over the number of polygons. For large `n`, consider spatial
  indexing or pre-filtering by bounding boxes before calling this utility.
- Rook contiguity (shared edge only) can be added later; `:queen` covers most use cases.
