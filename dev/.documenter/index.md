## What are Gaussian Markov Random Fields? {#What-are-Gaussian-Markov-Random-Fields?}

Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) are Gaussian distributions with sparse precision (inverse covariance) matrices. This sparsity structure makes them computationally efficient for large-scale problems while maintaining the expressiveness needed for complex spatial and temporal modeling.

## Quick Start {#Quick-Start}

Install the package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GaussianMarkovRandomFields")
using GaussianMarkovRandomFields
```
