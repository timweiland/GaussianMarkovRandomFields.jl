# # Spatiotemporal Modelling with SPDEs
#
# In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to perform spatiotemporal Bayesian
# inference using GMRFs based on a simple toy example.
#
# ## Problem setup
# Our goal is to model how a pollutant (i.e. some chemical) spreads across a
# river over time.
# We get (noisy) measurements of the pollutant concentration across the domain
# at time t = 0, and an additional measurement at some later point in time.
# To simplify things, we model the river as a 1D domain.
# Let's set up the problem:
x_left, x_right = -1.0, 1.0
Nₓ = 201
t_start, t_stop = 0.0, 1.0
Nₜ = 101
ts = range(t_start, t_stop, length = Nₜ)
f_initial = x -> exp(-(x + 0.6)^2 / 0.2^2)
xs_initial = range(x_left, x_right, length = Nₓ ÷ 2)
ys_initial = f_initial.(xs_initial)
noise_precision_initial = 0.1^(-2)

x_later = -0.25
y_later = 0.55
noise_precision_later = 0.01^(-2)

xs_all = [xs_initial; x_later]
ys_all = [ys_initial; y_later]
N_obs_all = length(ys_all)

# ## Using GMRFs for spatiotemporal modelling
# Fundamentally, we are interested in inferring a spatiotemporal function that
# models the pollutant concentration over time, which is an infinite-dimensional
# object.
# GMRFs, however, are finite-dimensional.
# This is not a limitation, it just means that we need to discretize space and
# time to ultimately obtain a discrete approximation to the infinite-dimensional
# object.
#
# We're going to do this as follows:
# 1. Set up a stochastic PDE (SPDE) that models the spatiotemporal,
#    infinite-dimensional prior (a Gaussian process).
# 2. Discretize the SPDE in space and time to obtain a GMRF which approximates
#    the Gaussian process.
# 3. Condition the GMRF on the observations to obtain the posterior.
#
# Let's start by setting up our discretizations:
using GaussianMarkovRandomFields
using Ferrite

grid = generate_grid(Line, (Nₓ - 1,), Tensors.Vec(x_left), Tensors.Vec(x_right))
interpolation = Lagrange{RefLine, 1}()
quadrature_rule = QuadratureRule{RefLine}(2)
disc = FEMDiscretization(grid, interpolation, quadrature_rule)

# ## A separable model
# Perhaps the simplest spatiotemporal model is a separable one, where the
# spatial and temporal components are independent.
# We can model both the spatial and temporal components using Matern processes:
spde_space = MaternSPDE{1}(range = 0.2, smoothness = 1, σ² = 0.3)
spde_time = MaternSPDE{1}(range = 0.5, smoothness = 1)

# Discretize:
x_space = discretize(spde_space, disc)
Q_s = precision_map(x_space)

grid_time = generate_grid(Line, (Nₜ - 1,), Tensors.Vec(t_start), Tensors.Vec(t_stop))
disc_time = FEMDiscretization(grid_time, interpolation, quadrature_rule)
x_time = discretize(spde_time, disc_time)
Q_t = precision_map(x_time)

# Create the separable spatiotemporal model:
x_st_kron = kronecker_product_spatiotemporal_model(Q_t, Q_s, disc)

# Great! Now let's condition on the observations.
# To do this, we construct a "spatial" observation matrix and transform it into
# a "spatiotemporal" observation matrix:
A_initial = evaluation_matrix(disc, [Tensors.Vec(x) for x in xs_initial])
t_initial_idx = 1 # Observe at first time point
A_initial = spatial_to_spatiotemporal(A_initial, t_initial_idx, Nₜ)
A_later = evaluation_matrix(disc, [Tensors.Vec(x_later)])
t_later_idx = 2 * Nₜ ÷ 3
A_later = spatial_to_spatiotemporal(A_later, t_later_idx, Nₜ)

A_all = [A_initial; A_later]

using LinearAlgebra, SparseArrays
Q_noise = sparse(I, N_obs_all, N_obs_all) * noise_precision_initial
Q_noise[end, end] = noise_precision_later

# Condition on the observations:
x_st_kron_posterior = condition_on_observations(x_st_kron, A_all, Q_noise, ys_all)

# Let's look at the dynamics of this posterior.
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!()
plot(x_st_kron_posterior, t_initial_idx)

#
plot(x_st_kron_posterior, Nₜ ÷ 3)

#
plot(x_st_kron_posterior, 2 * Nₜ ÷ 3)

#
plot(x_st_kron_posterior, Nₜ)

# We see that the effect of our observations effectively just "dies off" over
# time.
# And generally in spatiotemporal statistics, this is a fair assumption:
# The further away in time we are from an observation, the less it should
# influence our predictions.
#
# But in our case, we know a bit more about the phenomenon at hand.
# This is a river, and we know that it flows in a certain direction, and we
# probably also roughly know the flow speed.
# We should embed this information into our prior to get a more useful
# posterior!
#
# ## Advection-diffusion priors
# We can achieve this through a non-separable model that encodes these dynamics.
# Concretely, we are going to consider an advection-diffusion SPDE as presented
# in [Clarotto2024](@cite).
adv_diff_spde = AdvectionDiffusionSPDE{1}(
    γ = [-0.6],
    H = 0.1 * sparse(I, (1, 1)),
    τ = 0.1,
    α = 2 // 1,
    spatial_spde = spde_space,
    initial_spde = spde_space,
)

# To discretize this SPDE, we only need a FEM discretization of space.
# For time, we simply specify the discrete time points which are then used
# internally for an implicit Euler scheme.
x_adv_diff = discretize(adv_diff_spde, disc, ts)

# Condition on the initial observations:
x_adv_diff_posterior = condition_on_observations(x_adv_diff, A_all, Q_noise, ys_all)

# Let's look at the dynamics of this posterior.
plot(x_adv_diff_posterior, t_initial_idx)

#
plot(x_adv_diff_posterior, Nₜ ÷ 3)

#
plot(x_adv_diff_posterior, 2 * Nₜ ÷ 3)

#
plot(x_adv_diff_posterior, Nₜ)

# This looks much more reasonable!
# We see that the pollutant is transported downstream over time, and the
# observations at the later time point are consistent with this.
#
# ## Conclusion
# We have seen how to model spatiotemporal phenomena using GMRFs.
# We started with a simple separable model and then moved on to a more complex
# advection-diffusion model.
# The latter model was able to capture the dynamics of the river and the
# pollutant transport much better.
#
# As mentioned initially, this was a simple toy example.
# But the underlying principles are the same for more complex problems.
# In particular, all of the above should work the same for arbitrary spatial
# meshes, as demonstrated e.g. in the tutorial
# [Spatial Modelling with SPDEs](@ref).
