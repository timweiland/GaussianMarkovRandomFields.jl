# # Boundary Conditions for SPDEs
#
# In previous tutorials, we saw that we can approximate stochastic processes
# with GMRFs by discretizing stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs).
# Such discretizations always involve boundary conditions, which specify the
# behavior of the process at the boundary of the domain.
# In the context of the finite element method, the simplest boundary condition
# is a homogeneous von Neumann boundary condition, which specifies that the
# derivative of the process normal to the boundary is zero.
# This approach is also used in the seminal work by Lindgren et al. [Lindgren2011](@cite).
#
# Yet, in practice, this behavior is often not desirable.
# To circumvent boundary effects, people often artificially inflate the domain
# by adding a buffer zone around the data.
#
# But what if we know the behavior of the process at the boundary, and it's
# not "the normal derivative is zero"?
# Fortunately, GaussianMarkovRandomFields.jl interfaces rather smoothly with Ferrite.jl, which we
# can use to specify more complex boundary conditions. Let's see how this works.
#
# ## Spatial example: Matern SPDE
# We start by specifying a mesh over the interval [-1, 1].
using GaussianMarkovRandomFields, Ferrite
grid = generate_grid(Line, (50,))
interpolation = Lagrange{RefLine, 1}()
quadrature_rule = QuadratureRule{RefLine}(2)

# ### Dirichlet boundary
# Let us now use Ferrite to define a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition,
# which specifies that the process is zero at the boundary.
function get_dirichlet_constraint(grid::Ferrite.Grid{1})
    boundary = getfacetset(grid, "left") ∪ getfacetset(grid, "right")

    return Dirichlet(:u, boundary, x -> (x[1] ≈ -1.0) ? 0.0 : (x[1] ≈ 1.0) ? 0.0 : 0.0)
end

dbc = get_dirichlet_constraint(grid)

# GaussianMarkovRandomFields.jl supports such boundary conditions in a "soft" way.
# This means that we enforce the boundary conditions up to noise of a certain,
# user-specified magnitude.
# This ensures that the resulting GMRF has full rank.
# If you don't care much for probabilistic boundary conditions, you can just
# set the noise to a sufficiently small value.
bcs = [(dbc, 1.0e-4)] # 1e-4 is the noise in terms of the standard deviation

# We can now create a FEM discretization with the specified boundary conditions.
disc = FEMDiscretization(grid, interpolation, quadrature_rule, [(:u, nothing)], bcs)

# Let's now define some Matern SPDE and discretize it.
matern_spde = MaternSPDE{1}(range = 0.5, smoothness = 1, σ² = 0.3)
x = discretize(matern_spde, disc)

# Verify for yourself that the boundary value is zero for all samples, and that
# the variance vanishes at the boundary:
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!()
plot(x, disc)

# ### Periodic boundary
# We can also define a periodic boundary condition in terms of an affine
# constraint:
function get_periodic_constraint(grid::Ferrite.Grid{1})
    cellidx_left, dofidx_left = collect(grid.facetsets["left"])[1]
    cellidx_right, dofidx_right = collect(grid.facetsets["right"])[1]

    temp_dh = DofHandler(grid)
    add!(temp_dh, :u, Lagrange{RefLine, 1}())
    close!(temp_dh)
    cc = CellCache(temp_dh)
    get_dof(cell_idx, dof_idx) = (reinit!(cc, cell_idx); celldofs(cc)[dof_idx])
    dof_left = get_dof(cellidx_left, dofidx_left)
    dof_right = get_dof(cellidx_right, dofidx_right)

    return AffineConstraint(dof_left, [dof_right => 1.0], 0.0)
end

pbc = get_periodic_constraint(grid)

# The rest of the procedure is analogous to the Dirichlet case:
bcs = [(pbc, 1.0e-4)]
disc_periodic =
    FEMDiscretization(grid, interpolation, quadrature_rule, [(:u, nothing)], bcs)
x_periodic = discretize(matern_spde, disc_periodic)

# Verify for yourself that the values at the left and right boundary match
# for all samples:
plot(x_periodic, disc)

# ## Spatiotemporal example: Advection-Diffusion SPDE
# This works just as well in the spatiotemporal case.
# Let's reuse our previous discretization for a 1D advection-diffusion SPDE:
using LinearAlgebra, SparseArrays
spde = AdvectionDiffusionSPDE{1}(
    γ = [-0.6],
    H = 0.1 * sparse(I, (1, 1)),
    τ = 0.1,
    α = 2 // 1,
    spatial_spde = matern_spde,
    initial_spde = matern_spde,
)
ts = 0:0.05:1
N_t = length(ts)
x_adv_diff_dirichlet = discretize(spde, disc, ts)
x_adv_diff_periodic = discretize(spde, disc_periodic, ts)

# To make things clearer, we are going to condition these GMRFs on a Gaussian
# initial condition to see how it propagates over time.
xs_ic = -0.99:0.01:0.99
ys_ic = exp.(-xs_ic .^ 2 / 0.2^2)
A_ic = evaluation_matrix(disc, [Tensors.Vec(x) for x in xs_ic])
A_ic = spatial_to_spatiotemporal(A_ic, 1, N_t)

x_adv_diff_dirichlet = condition_on_observations(x_adv_diff_dirichlet, A_ic, 1.0e8, ys_ic)
x_adv_diff_periodic = condition_on_observations(x_adv_diff_periodic, A_ic, 1.0e8, ys_ic)

# First, check the initial observations:
plot(x_adv_diff_dirichlet, 1)

# Now, let's see how the process evolves over time:
plot(x_adv_diff_dirichlet, N_t ÷ 2)

#
plot(x_adv_diff_dirichlet, N_t)

# Compare to this to the periodic case:
plot(x_adv_diff_periodic, N_t ÷ 2)

#
plot(x_adv_diff_periodic, N_t)

# ## Conclusion
# We have seen how to specify more complex boundary conditions for GMRFs.
# All it takes is to construct the boundary conditions in Ferrite and add
# some noise.
#
# For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial considered discretizations of
# a one-dimensional interval, but of course the same principles apply to higher
# dimensions and more complex geometries.
